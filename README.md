GitHub Actions
GitHub has a feature called Actions, which is a way of automating tasks that come up as a result of writing code. 
The wording here is deliberately open-ended; you can do almost anything that you can do on your own computer in GitHub Actions, but in an automated way.
Some examples of things that you may want to automate are:

Running tests on the code every time a new commit is pushed to GitHub to make sure everything is working;
Checking if there have been reports of new security problems with libraries you use every morning;
Indexing how much of the code in your repository is covered by tests you wrote, and display a badge showing the percentage in the README;
Automatically update code running on servers whenever you pushed a commit to a certain branch;
Running your code after every push and upload the result to a web server.
